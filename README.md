# HTclang

### HTclang is a fork of HTVM that focuses solely on converting code to C.

Since this project started as a direct clone of HTVM, you may notice many files and code sections that are identical, not needed or very similar.
**Note:** Because of this, the code might seem confusing or out of context if you try to read or browse it without HTVM background.
